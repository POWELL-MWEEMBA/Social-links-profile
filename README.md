# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile Solution

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It’s a great exercise for practicing semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, responsive layouts, and accessibility best practices.

- Building accessible navigation and focus states
- how t structure Css by using global varailes font face
